# SOAR BACKEND DEVELOPER TECHNICAL CHALLENGE

This is an explanation of the file structure, including the additional files created for various entities and their purposes:  

### **Directories and Their Purposes**  

- **`routes/`**  
  Contains all the route definitions for the API endpoints.  

- **`managers/`**  
  Includes the business logic and data management for different entities.  
  - **`managers/entities/`**  
    Houses subdirectories for each entity:  
    - **`managers/entities/user/`**: Files related to the user entity.  
    - **`managers/entities/school/`**: Files related to the school entity.  
    - **`managers/entities/classroom/`**: Files related to the classroom entity.  
    - **`managers/entities/student/`**: Files related to the student entity.  

- **`mws/`** (Middleware)  
  Contains middleware functions:  
  - **`mws/authMiddleware.js`**: Middleware for authentication.  
  - **`mws/roleMiddleware.js`**: Middleware for role-based access control. 

- **`rate-limiting`**
  The project also implements rate limiting based on the user's IP address. This can be configured in the environment-specific configuration file located in the `config` folder. By default, the rate limit is set to 100 requests per 15 minutes.

- **`tests/`**  
  Contains all the unit and integration tests:  
  - **`tests/unit/`**: Unit tests for individual components and functions.  
  - **`tests/integration/`**: Integration tests for interactions between different components.  

- **`mochawesome-report/`**  
  Contains test reports generated by the Mochawesome reporter. 

- **`database-design-schema-diagram`**
    This is the schema diagram of all the entities used by the project.

- **`Soar.postman_collection.json`**
    This is a postman collection of all the endpoints executed on the local server as well the development server online. All the Autorization tokens are marked as `Bearer <jwt_token>` for security purpose of not exposing the authorization token.

- **`Test-Coverage.png`**
    This includes the overall coverage of the endpoint routes and business logic in the manager directory.

# Project Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run your project.

---

## Step 1: Use the Deployed APIs (Optional)

If you prefer not to set up the project locally, you can directly use the deployed APIs (using `Heroku`) available at the following URL:

- **Base URL**: [https://soar-school-management-system-ee8a8faad39d.herokuapp.com/](https://soar-school-management-system-ee8a8faad39d.herokuapp.com/)

### Key Features of the Deployed APIs
- The APIs are fully configured, including:
  - **MongoDB** via `MongoDB Atlas`.
  - **Redis** via `Redis Labs`.
- For faster access to the API endpoints, use the development folder inside the `Soar.postman_collection.json` file.

---

## Local Setup Instructions

If you prefer to set up the project locally, follow the steps below:

---

### Step 1: Install Node.js

1. Download and install **Node.js** from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Verify the installation by running:
    - Open your terminal and check the Node.js version by running `node -v`.

---

### Step 2: Install Redis

1. Download and install **Redis** from [https://redis.io/download](https://redis.io/download).
2. Once installed, start the Redis server:
    - Run `redis-server` to start the Redis service.
3. Verify that Redis is running by executing:
    - `redis-cli ping`. If Redis is running, it will return `PONG`.

---

### Step 3: Install MongoDB

1. Download and install **MongoDB** from [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2. Start the MongoDB service:
    - Ensure MongoDB is running on its default port **27017**.
3. Open your terminal and connect to MongoDB:
    - Use the MongoDB shell:
      ```shell
      mongo
      ```
4. Create your project database by running:
    ```shell
    use your_database_name
    ```
5. Confirm the database creation by executing:
    ```shell
    show dbs
    ```

---

### Step 4: Clone the Project Repository

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using:
    ```shell
    git clone <git-repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory on your computer.

---

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following command to install all required project dependencies:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

---

### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

#### Local Environment Configuration

If you are running the project locally, update your environment variables in the `/config/envs/local.js` file.

1. Open the `/config/envs/local.js` file.
2. Set the following environment variables:
    - `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
    - `CACHE_REDIS`: Your Redis connection string.
    - `CORTEX_URI`: Any additional service URL you need.
    - `USER_PORT`: Port number for your application.

---

### Step 7: Run Tests

1. To run the test suite, use the following command:
    ```shell
    npm test
    ```

---

### Step 8: Start the Application

1. To start the project locally, run:
    ```shell
    node app.js local
    ```

2. Your application should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### Full Application Workflow

1. **Create a Superadmin User**
    - A **superadmin user** is created with access to all endpoints across the system.
2. **Authenticate the Superadmin User**
    - Authenticate the superadmin user to obtain an authentication token.

3. **Create a Schooladmin User**
    - A **schooladmin user** is created under the superadmin’s supervision.

4. **Authenticate the Schooladmin User**
    - Authenticate the schooladmin user to get their authentication token.

5. **Create a School**
    - The **superadmin** creates a school, assigning a schooladmin as the school administrator.
    - Only **superadmins** have access to all school-related endpoints.

6. **Link Schooladmin with a School**
    - The schooladmin user must be updated with the school reference in their user object.
    - If a schooladmin is not linked with a school, they won’t have access to that school's resources.

7. **Perform CRUD Operations for Classrooms and Students**
    - Once the schooladmin is linked to a school, they can create, update, and delete:
        - **Classrooms**
        - **Students**
    - This allows management of classrooms and students within a school environment.

8. **Transfer Students Across Classrooms**
    - Transferring students from one classroom to another has a built-in validation check.
    - If the destination classroom's capacity is full, a student cannot be added to it.

## Note

 **For the purpose of this task, all delete endpoints have been intentionally designed to perform hard deletions, removing the document permanently from the database. I have opted not to implement soft delete functionality or maintain metadata fields such as `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by` or a `deleted` flag.**
